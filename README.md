# New awesome card game

## The rules

The rules are pretty simple. From a regular deck of 52 cards, each player receives the same amount of card (depending on the number of players). Each turn, each player will play one and only card of his/her choice and when it is done, the player with the highest card wins points (see following section for point system). The game ends when a player reaches 50 points and wins or when no one has any cards left and in this case, there is no winner. Between 2 and 8 players can play one game. 

## Point system

The highest card gives this amount of points:

- As brings 15 points
- King brings 13 points
- Queen brings 12 points
- Joker brings 11 points
- 10 brings 10 points 
- 9 brings 9 points
...
- 2 brings 2 points

## This is all you need to know to play and have fun !
